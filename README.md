### What I learned

I learned how to use `Airtable` and how to use the API granted by registering on Airtable to manage and organize data for my website. It feels beneficial for me to review how to use APIs and implement `asynchronous functions` in JavaScript, as it helps refresh your knowledge and skills in these areas. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in working with `data management tools`.

This project was an opportunity for me to create a real portfolio website that I could use to showcase my skills and attract job opportunities. One challenge I faced was finding a suitable image of myself that would fit the design. To solve this, I researched and used `Stable Diffusion` and `Dreambooth` extensions to train my own AI model with images of myself. I also used Stable Diffusion to generate the favicon for the website. `ChatGPT` helped me rephrase some of the text on the website. Working with AI technology was a fun and important learning experience.
